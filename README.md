# dynamic-div-creation

## Simple script that creates divs using a click event and animates them by double clicking on the background

- By clicking on any div the user creates four smaller divs of equal size and positioned randomly on the screen. The newly created elements will also be given a random background color.

- Double clicking the background will toggle the animation of all the elements on the screen. They will move to a random position but will always fit inside the body container.
